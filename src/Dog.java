    // constructor methods
    // A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects
    // The constructor is called when an object of a class is created
    // In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.
    // It is called when an instance of the class is created
    // At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory
    // Note: It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class.
    // It is because java compiler creates a default constructor if your class doesnâ€™t have any.
    // Constructors do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
    // Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any number of times.
